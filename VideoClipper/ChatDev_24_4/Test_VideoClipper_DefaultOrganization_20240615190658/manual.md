## What is VideoClipper?

VideoClipper is a software application that allows users to easily clip and trim videos. It provides an intuitive interface to select specific sections of the video, and saves the trimmed video as a new file. 

## How to Use VideoClipper?

1. **Open Video:** Click on the "Open Video" button to select the video you want to trim. The video file should be in one of the following formats: .mp4, .avi, .mov.

2. **Set Clip Time:** After opening the video, click on the "Set Clip Time" button. You will be asked to enter the start time and end time for the clip. The time should be entered in seconds. For example, if you want to trim the video from the 1-minute mark to the 2-minute mark, you should enter 60 for the start time and 120 for the end time.

3. **Save Video:** Once you have set the clip time, click on the "Save Video" button to save the trimmed video as a new file. You will be asked to choose a location to save the new video file.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors while using VideoClipper, a message box will appear with a description of the error. Most errors are caused by entering invalid start or end times for the clip. Please make sure that the start time is less than the end time, and that both times are within the duration of the video.
