## ðŸ¤” What is this?

Alliance Conqueror is a strategy game where players form alliances and compete to conquer territories. The game is turn-based, meaning each player takes a turn to make their moves. The game continues until all territories have been claimed, at which point the alliance with the most territories is declared the winner.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. Run the game using the command `./game`.

2. The game will automatically create two players and two alliances, and assign each player to an alliance.

3. Each player will take a turn to make their moves. This could involve attacking a territory, defending their own territory, or moving their forces.

4. The game ends when all territories have been claimed. The alliance with the most territories is declared the winner.
