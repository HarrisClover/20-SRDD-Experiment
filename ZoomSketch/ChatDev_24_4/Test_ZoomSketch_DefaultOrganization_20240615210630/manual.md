# Collaborative Sketching Software

A real-time collaborative sketching software where multiple users can draw together on a shared canvas.

## Quick Install

Before you start, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. If not, you can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/ChatDev/collaborative-sketching.git`

Navigate to the project directory:

`cd collaborative-sketching`

Install the dependencies:

`npm install`

Start the server:

`node server.js`

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to start sketching!

## Main Functions

- **Real-time Collaboration:** Multiple users can draw on the same canvas at the same time. Any changes made by one user are instantly visible to all other users.

- **Responsive Design:** The canvas automatically adjusts its size to fit the window. This ensures that users can draw comfortably regardless of their screen size.

- **Touch Support:** Users can draw using their mouse or their fingers (on touch-enabled devices).

## How to Use

1. **Start Drawing:** Click or tap on the canvas to start drawing. Move your mouse or finger around to draw. Release the mouse button or lift your finger to stop drawing.

2. **Collaborate:** Invite others to join by sharing the URL of the page. They will be able to see your drawings in real-time and contribute their own.

3. **Resize Canvas:** If you resize your browser window, the canvas will automatically adjust to fit the new size. Your drawings will be preserved.

Enjoy sketching and collaborating in real-time!
