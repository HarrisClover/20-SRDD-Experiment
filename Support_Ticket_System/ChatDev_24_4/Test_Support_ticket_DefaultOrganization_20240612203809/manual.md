## What is this?

Our Support Ticket System is designed to help businesses manage their customer support tickets efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface where support agents can create and track tickets, assign them to specific agents, set priority levels, and communicate with customers. The system also offers features like automated ticket escalation, ticket status tracking, and reporting to ensure efficient ticket management and customer satisfaction.

## Key Features

**Ticket Creation:** Support agents can create tickets for each customer query or issue.

**Ticket Assignment:** Tickets can be assigned to specific agents for resolution.

**Priority Setting:** Each ticket can be assigned a priority level based on the severity of the issue.

**Communication:** Support agents can communicate with customers directly through the system.

**Automated Ticket Escalation:** If a ticket remains open or in progress for too long, its priority level is automatically escalated.

**Ticket Status Tracking:** The status of each ticket can be tracked in real time.

**Reporting:** The system generates reports to help businesses monitor their ticket resolution process and customer satisfaction levels.
