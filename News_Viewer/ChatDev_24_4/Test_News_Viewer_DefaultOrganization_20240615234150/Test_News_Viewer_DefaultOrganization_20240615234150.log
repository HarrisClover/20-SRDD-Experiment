Given the nature of the task, I believe an Application would be the most suitable modality for our product. This is because an application can provide a user-friendly interface and can be easily updated to include news from various sources. It also allows for real-time updates, which is crucial for a news viewer software. The application can be designed to categorize news based on topics, sources, or regions, and users can customize their news feed based on their preferences. 

We can also incorporate features such as search functionality, save for later, share news, and push notifications for breaking news. The application can be developed for both mobile and desktop platforms to cater to a wider audience. 

However, I am open to other suggestions and would like to hear your thoughts on this.

I agree with your suggestion. An application would indeed be the most suitable modality for our product. It allows for a more interactive and engaging user experience. The features you mentioned, such as search functionality, save for later, share news, and push notifications for breaking news, are all essential for a news viewer software. Developing the application for both mobile and desktop platforms would also ensure that we cater to a wider audience. Therefore, I support your decision to proceed with an application as our product modality.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: News Viewer is a simple and user-friendly software application that allows users to view and read news articles from various sources..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "News Viewer is a simple and user-friendly software application that allows users to view and read news articles from various sources.".

Task description: "".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: News Viewer is a simple and user-friendly software application that allows users to view and read news articles from various sources..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Sure, I will design the application in Python using the Tkinter library for GUI and the requests library for fetching news from various sources. 

Let's start with the main file, which will be responsible for initializing the application and setting up the GUI.

main.py

```python

'''
This is the main file for the News Viewer application. It sets up the GUI and initializes the application.
'''

import tkinter as tk
from news_viewer import NewsViewer

def main():
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = NewsViewer(master=root)
    app.mainloop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Now, let's move on to the NewsViewer class, which will be responsible for fetching and displaying the news.

news_viewer.py

```python

'''
This file contains the NewsViewer class, which is responsible for fetching and displaying the news.
'''

import tkinter as tk
import requests

class NewsViewer(tk.Frame):
    def __init__(self, master=None):
        super().__init__(master)
        self.master = master
        self.pack()
        self.create_widgets()

    def create_widgets(self):
        self.news_label = tk.Label(self)
        self.news_label.pack(side="top")

        self.refresh_button = tk.Button(self)
        self.refresh_button["text"] = "Refresh"
        self.refresh_button["command"] = self.update_news
        self.refresh_button.pack(side="bottom")

    def update_news(self):
        # Here, you should replace 'your-api-key' and 'your-source' with your actual API key and news source
        response = requests.get('https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources=your-source&apiKey=your-api-key')
        data = response.json()
        news = data['articles'][0]['title']
        self.news_label["text"] = news

```

This code will create a simple GUI with a label to display the news and a button to refresh the news. When the button is clicked, it will fetch the latest news from the specified source and display it in the label. Please replace 'your-api-key' and 'your-source' with your actual API key and news source.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and there are many ways to improve and expand this application, such as adding the ability to choose from multiple news sources, displaying more than one news article at a time, adding images, etc.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.

Here is a new customer's task: News Viewer is a simple and user-friendly software application that allows users to view and read news articles from various sources..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is a good start for the News Viewer application. However, there is a crucial point that needs to be addressed to ensure the application works as expected.

Comment with the highest priority: The API key and news source are hardcoded as 'your-api-key' and 'your-source' in the `update_news` method. This will not work because these are placeholders and not actual values. 

Revision suggestion: The API key and news source should be parameters that can be passed to the `NewsViewer` class during initialization. This way, the user can specify their own API key and news source when they create an instance of the `NewsViewer` class. Here's how you can do it:

```python
class NewsViewer(tk.Frame):
    def __init__(self, master=None, api_key=None, source=None):
        super().__init__(master)
        self.master = master
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.source = source
        self.pack()
        self.create_widgets()

    def update_news(self):
        response = requests.get(f'https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources={self.source}&apiKey={self.api_key}')
        data = response.json()
        news = data['articles'][0]['title']
        self.news_label["text"] = news
```

In the `main` function, you can then create an instance of `NewsViewer` like this:

```python
def main():
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = NewsViewer(master=root, api_key='your-api-key', source='your-source')
    app.mainloop()
```

Remember to replace 'your-api-key' and 'your-source' with your actual API key and news source.

In the `main` function, you can then create an instance of `NewsViewer` like this:

```python
def main():
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = NewsViewer(master=root, api_key='your-api-key', source='your-source')
    app.mainloop()

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is a good start for the News Viewer application. However, there is a crucial point that needs to be addressed to ensure the application works as expected.

Comment with the highest priority: The API key and news source are hardcoded as 'your-api-key' and 'your-source' in the `update_news` method. This will not work because these are placeholders and not actual values. 

Revision suggestion: The API key and news source should be parameters that can be passed to the `NewsViewer` class during initialization. This way, the user can specify their own API key and news source when they create an instance of the `NewsViewer` class. Here's how you can do it:

```python
class NewsViewer(tk.Frame):
    def __init__(self, master=None, api_key=None, source=None):
        super().__init__(master)
        self.master = master
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.source = source
        self.pack()
        self.create_widgets()

    def update_news(self):
        response = requests.get(f'https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources={self.source}&apiKey={self.api_key}')
        data = response.json()
        news = data['articles'][0]['title']
        self.news_label["text"] = news
```

In the `main` function, you can then create an instance of `NewsViewer` like this:

```python
def main():
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = NewsViewer(master=root, api_key='your-api-key', source='your-source')
    app.mainloop()
```

Remember to replace 'your-api-key' and 'your-source' with your actual API key and news source."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: News Viewer is a simple and user-friendly software application that allows users to view and read news articles from various sources..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is well-structured and follows good practices. However, there's one major issue that needs to be addressed. The application currently only displays the title of the first article from the fetched news data. This doesn't fully meet the user's requirement of being able to "view and read news articles from various sources". 

Here's my suggestion to improve this:

We can create a listbox in the GUI to display the titles of all the fetched articles. When a title is selected from the listbox, we can display the content of that article. 

Here's how you can modify the `create_widgets` and `update_news` methods in the `NewsViewer` class:

```python
def create_widgets(self):
    self.news_listbox = tk.Listbox(self)
    self.news_listbox.pack(side="top", fill="both", expand=True)
    self.news_listbox.bind('<<ListboxSelect>>', self.on_select)
    self.refresh_button = tk.Button(self)
    self.refresh_button["text"] = "Refresh"
    self.refresh_button["command"] = self.update_news
    self.refresh_button.pack(side="bottom")

def update_news(self):
    response = requests.get(f'https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources={self.source}&apiKey={self.api_key}')
    data = response.json()
    self.articles = data['articles']
    self.news_listbox.delete(0, 'end')
    for article in self.articles:
        self.news_listbox.insert('end', article['title'])

def on_select(self, event):
    selected_index = self.news_listbox.curselection()[0]
    selected_article = self.articles[selected_index]
    tk.messagebox.showinfo("Article", selected_article['content'])
```

In the `create_widgets` method, we create a listbox and bind a method `on_select` to it which will be called when an item is selected from the listbox. In the `update_news` method, we fetch the articles and insert their titles into the listbox. The `on_select` method shows a messagebox with the content of the selected article. 

Please note that you need to import the `messagebox` module from `tkinter` for this to work:

```python
import tkinter.messagebox as messagebox
```

This way, the user can view and read multiple news articles, which is more in line with the task requirements.

    self.news_listbox.delete(0, 'end')
    for article in self.articles:
        self.news_listbox.insert('end', article['title'])

def on_select(self, event):
    selected_index = self.news_listbox.curselection()[0]
    selected_article = self.articles[selected_index]
    tk.messagebox.showinfo("Article", selected_article['content'])

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task, our designed product modality, languages and ideas, our developed first-edition source codes are listed below: 
Task: "News Viewer is a simple and user-friendly software application that allows users to view and read news articles from various sources.".
Modality: "application".
Programming Language: " Python"
Ideas: ""
Codes: 
"main.py
```python
'''
This is the main file for the News Viewer application. It sets up the GUI and initializes the application.
'''
import tkinter as tk
from news_viewer import NewsViewer
def main():
    # Replace 'your-api-key' and 'your-source' with your actual API key and news source
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = NewsViewer(master=root, api_key='your-api-key', source='your-source')
    app.mainloop()
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

news_viewer.py
```python
'''
This file contains the NewsViewer class, which is responsible for fetching and displaying the news.

    def __init__(self, master=None, api_key=None, source=None):
        super().__init__(master)
        self.master = master
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.source = source
        self.pack()
        self.create_widgets()
    def create_widgets(self):
        self.news_label = tk.Label(self)
        self.news_label.pack(side="top")
        self.refresh_button = tk.Button(self)
        self.refresh_button["text"] = "Refresh"
        self.refresh_button["command"] = self.update_news
        self.refresh_button.pack(side="bottom")
    def update_news(self):
        response = requests.get(f'https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources={self.source}&apiKey={self.api_key}')
        data = response.json()
        news = data['articles'][0]['title']
        self.news_label["text"] = news
```

"
Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is well-structured and follows good practices. However, there's one major issue that needs to be addressed. The application currently only displays the title of the first article from the fetched news data. This doesn't fully meet the user's requirement of being able to "view and read news articles from various sources". 

Here's my suggestion to improve this:

We can create a listbox in the GUI to display the titles of all the fetched articles. When a title is selected from the listbox, we can display the content of that article. 

Here's how you can modify the `create_widgets` and `update_news` methods in the `NewsViewer` class:

```python
def create_widgets(self):
    self.news_listbox = tk.Listbox(self)
    self.news_listbox.pack(side="top", fill="both", expand=True)
    self.news_listbox.bind('<<ListboxSelect>>', self.on_select)
    self.refresh_button = tk.Button(self)
    self.refresh_button["text"] = "Refresh"
    self.refresh_button["command"] = self.update_news
    self.refresh_button.pack(side="bottom")

def update_news(self):
    response = requests.get(f'https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources={self.source}&apiKey={self.api_key}')
    data = response.json()
    self.articles = data['articles']
    self.news_listbox.delete(0, 'end')
    for article in self.articles:
        self.news_listbox.insert('end', article['title'])

def on_select(self, event):
    selected_index = self.news_listbox.curselection()[0]
    selected_article = self.articles[selected_index]
    tk.messagebox.showinfo("Article", selected_article['content'])
```

In the `create_widgets` method, we create a listbox and bind a method `on_select` to it which will be called when an item is selected from the listbox. In the `update_news` method, we fetch the articles and insert their titles into the listbox. The `on_select` method shows a messagebox with the content of the selected article. 

Please note that you need to import the `messagebox` module from `tkinter` for this to work:

```python
import tkinter.messagebox as messagebox
```

This way, the user can view and read multiple news articles, which is more in line with the task requirements."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

When a title is selected from the listbox, we can display the content of that article. \n\nHere\'s how you can modify the create_widgets and update_news methods in the NewsViewer class:\n\npython\ndef create_widgets(self):\n    self.news_listbox = tk.Listbox(self)\n    self.news_listbox.pack(side="top", fill="both", expand=True)\n    self.news_listbox.bind(\'&lt;&lt;ListboxSelect&gt;&gt;\', self.on_select)\n    self.refresh_button = tk.Button(self)\n    self.refresh_button["text"] = "Refresh"\n    self.refresh_button["command"] = self.update_news\n    self.refresh_button.pack(side="bottom")\n\ndef update_news(self):\n    response = requests.get(f\'https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources={self.source}&amp;apiKey={self.api_key}\')\n    data = response.json()\n    self.articles = data[\'articles\']\n    self.news_listbox.delete(0, \'end\')\n    for article in self.articles:\n        self.news_listbox.insert(\'end\', article[\'title\'])\n\ndef on_select(self, event):\n    selected_index = self.news_listbox.curselection()[0]\n    selected_article = self.articles[selected_index]\n    tk.messagebox.showinfo("Article", selected_article[\'content\'])\n\n\nIn the create_widgets method, we create a listbox and bind a method on_select to it which will be called when an item is selected from the listbox. In the update_news method, we fetch the articles and insert their titles into the listbox. The on_select method shows a messagebox with the content of the selected article. \n\nPlease note that you need to import the messagebox module from tkinter for this to work:\n\npython\nimport tkinter.messagebox as messagebox\n\n\nThis way, the user can view and read multiple news articles, which is more in line with the task requirements.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: News Viewer is a simple and user-friendly software application that allows users to view and read news articles from various sources..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The code provided is well-structured and follows good programming practices. However, there is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. The application is currently set to fetch news from a single source only, which is not in line with the customer's requirement of viewing and reading news articles from various sources.

Here is my suggestion to revise the code:

In the `NewsViewer` class, you should modify the `__init__` method to accept a list of sources instead of a single source. Then, in the `update_news` method, you should iterate over the list of sources and fetch news from each source. 

Here is how you can implement this:

```python
class NewsViewer(tk.Frame):
    def __init__(self, master=None, api_key=None, sources=None):
        super().__init__(master)
        self.master = master
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.sources = sources
        self.pack()
        self.create_widgets()

    def update_news(self):
        self.articles = []
        for source in self.sources:
            response = requests.get(f'https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources={source}&apiKey={self.api_key}')
            data = response.json()
            self.articles.extend(data['articles'])
        self.news_listbox.delete(0, 'end')
        for article in self.articles:
            self.news_listbox.insert('end', article['title'])
```

And in the `main` function, you should pass a list of sources to the `NewsViewer` class:

```python
def main():
    # Replace 'your-api-key' and 'your-sources' with your actual API key and news sources
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = NewsViewer(master=root, api_key='your-api-key', sources=['source1', 'source2', 'source3'])
    app.mainloop()
```

This way, the application will be able to fetch and display news from multiple sources, as per the customer's requirement.

Comments on Codes:
"The code provided is well-structured and follows good programming practices. However, there is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. The application is currently set to fetch news from a single source only, which is not in line with the customer's requirement of viewing and reading news articles from various sources.

Here is my suggestion to revise the code:

In the `NewsViewer` class, you should modify the `__init__` method to accept a list of sources instead of a single source. Then, in the `update_news` method, you should iterate over the list of sources and fetch news from each source. 

Here is how you can implement this:

```python
class NewsViewer(tk.Frame):
    def __init__(self, master=None, api_key=None, sources=None):
        super().__init__(master)
        self.master = master
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.sources = sources
        self.pack()
        self.create_widgets()

    def update_news(self):
        self.articles = []
        for source in self.sources:
            response = requests.get(f'https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources={source}&apiKey={self.api_key}')
            data = response.json()
            self.articles.extend(data['articles'])
        self.news_listbox.delete(0, 'end')
        for article in self.articles:
            self.news_listbox.insert('end', article['title'])
```

And in the `main` function, you should pass a list of sources to the `NewsViewer` class:

```python
def main():
    # Replace 'your-api-key' and 'your-sources' with your actual API key and news sources
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = NewsViewer(master=root, api_key='your-api-key', sources=['source1', 'source2', 'source3'])
    app.mainloop()
```

This way, the application will be able to fetch and display news from multiple sources, as per the customer's requirement."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

As the Chief Executive Officer, I approve the requirements.txt file provided by the Programmer. However, I would like to add that it's crucial to keep the dependencies up-to-date and ensure that the versions used are compatible with each other to prevent any potential issues in the future. 

Furthermore, I would like to emphasize the importance of testing the application thoroughly in different environments to ensure its proper functioning. This includes testing the application with different versions of the dependencies if possible. 

Lastly, I would recommend creating a document detailing the steps to set up the development environment for new developers. This document should include instructions on how to install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. 

Here is a draft of the setup instructions:

```
Setup Instructions:

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your machine. The News Viewer application is built using Python, so it is a necessary prerequisite.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

4. Install the dependencies using pip, Python's package installer. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application using the following command:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
```

Please review and let me know if there are any changes needed.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
